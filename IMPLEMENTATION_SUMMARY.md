# Video Upload Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the video upload functionality that allows storing videos directly in MySQL using LONGBLOB format instead of external links.

## Overview

The implementation enables administrators to upload video files directly to the server, which are then stored in the MySQL database as LONGBLOB data. This provides a self-contained solution without relying on external video hosting services.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Frontend (React)

**Upload Component (`frontend/src/pages/Upload.js`)**:
- Added file input field for direct video uploads
- Implemented toggle between URL and file upload methods
- Added file validation and size display
- Disabled URL field when a file is selected
- Updated form submission to handle both URL and file uploads

**Video Player Component (`frontend/src/components/VideoPlayer.js`)**:
- Added detection for locally stored videos (uploadType = 'file')
- Implemented use of `/api/v1/videos/:id/file` endpoint for local videos
- Maintained support for URL-based videos

### 2. Backend (Node.js/Express)

**Video Model (`backend/src/models/Video.js`)**:
- Added `videoFile` field with LONGBLOB data type
- Added `fileName`, `fileSize`, and `mimeType` fields for file metadata
- Added `uploadType` ENUM field to distinguish between URL and file uploads

**Video Controller (`backend/src/controllers/video.js`)**:
- Enhanced `newVideo` function to handle file uploads
- Added `getVideoFile` function to serve video files from database
- Implemented HTTP range request support for smooth video streaming

**Video Routes (`backend/src/routes/video.js`)**:
- Configured Multer middleware for handling file uploads
- Added route for serving video files: `GET /api/v1/videos/:id/file`
- Set 500MB file size limit with video file type validation

**Admin Controller (`backend/src/controllers/admin.js`)**:
- Updated `getVideos` function to include file upload metadata

### 3. Database

**MySQL Configuration**:
- Using LONGBLOB data type for storing video files
- Proper connection settings for handling large binary data

## How It Works

### File Upload Process

1. Admin navigates to the upload page
2. Admin can either:
   - Select a video file using the file input, or
   - Enter a video URL in the URL field
3. When a file is selected, the URL field is disabled
4. Form is submitted with multipart/form-data encoding
5. Backend processes the upload:
   - For file uploads: Stores file data in LONGBLOB column
   - For URL uploads: Stores URL as before
6. Video metadata is saved to the database

### Video Playback

1. When a video is requested, the system checks the `uploadType` field
2. For locally stored videos (`uploadType = 'file'`):
   - Video player uses the `/api/v1/videos/:id/file` endpoint
   - Backend streams video data from the database with range request support
3. For URL-based videos:
   - Video player uses the existing URL handling logic

## Technical Details

### Storage

- Videos are stored directly in MySQL using LONGBLOB columns
- Maximum file size: 500MB (configurable)
- Supported formats: All video MIME types
- File metadata stored in separate columns (filename, size, MIME type)

### Streaming

- HTTP range request support for smooth playback
- Proper content headers for video streaming
- Memory-efficient streaming implementation

### Security

- File type validation to prevent malicious uploads
- Authentication and authorization required for uploads
- Admin-only access to upload functionality
- Proper error handling and validation

## Benefits

1. **Self-contained**: No dependency on external video hosting services
2. **Simple deployment**: Everything is stored in the database
3. **Secure**: Videos are protected by the application's authentication system
4. **Scalable**: Supports HTTP range requests for efficient streaming
5. **Flexible**: Supports both URL and file upload methods

## Limitations

1. **Database size**: Large video files will increase database size significantly
2. **Performance**: Database performance may be impacted by large binary data
3. **Backup complexity**: Database backups will include large video files
4. **File size limit**: Currently limited to 500MB per video

## Usage Instructions

### Uploading a Video File

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to the upload page
3. Fill in the video title, description, and category
4. Select a video file using the "Upload Video File" input
5. Optionally provide a custom thumbnail URL
6. Click "Upload Video"

### Uploading a Video URL

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to the upload page
3. Fill in the video title, description, and category
4. Enter a valid YouTube, Vimeo, or direct video URL
5. Thumbnail will be auto-generated for YouTube/Vimeo videos
6. Click "Upload Video"

## Future Improvements

1. Add video compression/transcoding
2. Implement chunked uploads for large files
3. Add progress indicators for uploads
4. Implement video processing queue
5. Add support for video thumbnails generation
6. Optimize database storage (consider file system storage for large deployments)
