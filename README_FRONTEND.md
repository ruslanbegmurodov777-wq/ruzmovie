# Movie Website - Admin Video Upload System

## Overview
I've successfully created a comprehensive movie website frontend with admin-only video upload functionality. Here's what has been implemented:

## Key Features

### 1. Admin-Only Video Upload
- Only users with `isAdmin: true` in the database can upload videos
- Regular users cannot access the upload functionality
- Backend endpoint `/api/videos` requires admin authentication

### 2. Frontend Components Created

#### Pages:
- **Home** (`/`) - Displays all videos in a grid layout
- **Login** (`/login`) - User authentication
- **Register** (`/register`) - New user registration  
- **VideoWatch** (`/video/:id`) - Watch individual videos with comments and likes
- **Search** (`/search`) - Search videos by title/description
- **Profile** (`/profile`) - User profile and subscriptions
- **Upload** (`/upload`) - Admin-only video upload (restricted)
- **AdminPanel** (`/admin`) - Admin dashboard for managing videos and users

#### Components:
- **Header** - Navigation with search and admin links
- **VideoCard** - Video display component with thumbnails and metadata

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Admin role checking
- Protected routes for admin functions
- Context-based state management

### 4. Admin Panel Features
- **Video Management**: View all videos, delete videos
- **User Management**: View all users, delete users
- **Upload Videos**: Admin-only video upload with title, description, URL, and thumbnail

### 5. Backend Integration
- Modified video routes to require admin privileges for uploads
- Admin endpoints for video/user management
- Proper error handling and validation

## How to Use

### For Regular Users:
1. Register/Login to the website
2. Browse videos on the home page
3. Search for specific videos
4. Watch videos with comments and interactions
5. View and manage profile

### For Administrators:
1. Login with an admin account (user must have `isAdmin: true` in database)
2. Access "Upload Video" and "Admin Panel" from the header
3. Upload new movies/videos with proper metadata
4. Manage existing videos and users through the admin panel

## Database Requirements
To make a user an admin, update the user record in the database:
```sql
UPDATE Users SET isAdmin = true WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

## Security Features
- Admin role verification on both frontend and backend
- JWT token authentication
- Protected API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling for unauthorized access

## Styling
- Modern, responsive design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Netflix-inspired color scheme (red/black/white)

The system is now ready for deployment and use. Only designated administrators can upload videos, ensuring content control and quality management.
